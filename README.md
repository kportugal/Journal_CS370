_Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?_

For this project, I was provided with three critical files: GameExperience.py, TreasureMaze.py, and TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. These files contained the foundation for managing the agent's memory, defining the maze environment, and implementing the game logic. I implemented the reinforcement learning algorithm, specifically a Q-learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach. I worked on the neural network architecture for the agent, developed the training loop, implemented exploration and exploitation strategies, and added visualization code to track the agent's progress. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
_What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?_

Computer scientists solve complex problems through computational thinking and technology. Their work is important because it helps create new things in many areas, like AI and cybersecurity. This improves the quality of life for everyone and increases efficiency. Their work shapes how we use computers and the Internet in our daily lives, enabling advancements in healthcare, communication, and banking.

_How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?_

When computer scientists face a problem, they break things into smaller manageable pieces. They look for patterns and create step-by-step plans to solve it. They first understand the problem, then think about what's needed to fix it. After that, they design a solution, write the computer code, and test it to ensure it works well. They also consider how to make their solution work for more people and its potential future adaptaions. 

_What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?_

Ethical responsibilities to end users and organizations are crucial in computer science. Ethical responsibilities include ensuring data privacy and security, designing inclusive and accessible systems, being transparent about AI decision-making processes, and considering the societal impact of technological solutions. Computer scientists must also strive for fairness in algorithms, avoid bias in AI systems, and prioritize the well-being of users over profit. Additionally, they have a responsibility to communicate potential risks and limitations of their work to stakeholders and to continuously update their knowledge to address emerging ethical challenges in technology.
